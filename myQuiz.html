/*************** Algorithm ******************
1. Create a questions list.
2. Create an answers list. 
3. Create a display question function that will display the elements of the question array in the question box. Ensure that once the function reaches the end of the list, it repeats. 
4. Create an update score function that will check if the users answer is correct or false and increases the score if it is true and keeps it the same if it is false. 
5. Create a check answer function that checks if the users answer corresponds to the answers array and alerts true if it does and false if it does not. 
6. Test the functions to make sure they work!
7. Add a fun background!
8. Try out your finished quiz!
